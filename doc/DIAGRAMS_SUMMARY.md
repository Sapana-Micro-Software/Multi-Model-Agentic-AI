## Paper (paper.tex)

### ✅ Diagrams and Visualizations Added:

1. **Performance Benchmark Table** (Table 1)
   - 8 metrics with descriptions and values
   - Formatted with booktabs and tabularx

2. **Latency Chart** (Figure 1)
   - Bar chart using pgfplots/TikZ
   - Shows latency for 7 different metrics
   - Professional styling with axis labels

3. **Scalability Analysis Chart** (Figure 2)
   - Dual-axis line chart
   - Shows throughput and latency vs. number of agents
   - Demonstrates linear scalability

4. **Feature Comparison Matrix** (Table 2)
   - 16 characteristics compared across 3 systems
   - Checkmarks and X marks for visual comparison
   - Shows our system implements all 16 features

### Packages Used:
